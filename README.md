OpenJudge
=========

A judge I made to judge the simple programming competitions in college.
A django based web server to provide the interface.
A linux shell based python mashup to provide the checking of the code.

Useage
------

1. Register users with question.models.nplayer()
2. run the server with ./runserver

I recommend a virtualenv with all the requirements satisfied.
